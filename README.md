### What I learned

Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of responsive design. Although I've been learning JavaScript for a while, I realized I had neglected CSS, which is a weak point for me. This challenge was a great opportunity to focus more on CSS fundamentals.

I particularly focused on key techniques for creating fluid layouts. For instance, using `max-width` on the main component allows it to shrink on smaller screens while preventing it from growing too large on bigger ones.

```css
article {
  max-width: 320px;
}
```

Additionally, I learned the importance of making images responsive by setting their width to 100%. This ensures the image scales down to fit its container and never overflows.

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

My main focus for future development is strengthening my core skills in CSS and responsive design. Although I applied the basics in this project, I want to explore more advanced techniques and become more confident in building complex, adaptive layouts from scratch.
